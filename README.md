# HelloMaven_boilerplate
Simple project which uses Maven for building the project

PS: Code in the editor gets automatically saved (but not committed) before you run any command, hence do not worry about saving the file

#### Working instructions
- This is a maven project, hence you can see the project is structured or organised in a specific way
- Project follows such a structure to well organise the code and refer to each class in unique way, using Reverse Domain Naming convention
- Follow further below to compile and run the program, which follows maven project build lifecycle
- Click on `BUILD & RUN` button, which displays command buttons and fields to enter commad line argumetns
- Now you can execute any of the "Compile", "Package" and "Test" commands, unless instructed no command line argumetns are needed further
- "Compile" only verifies the code and compiles or generates class files, does not package, does not run test cases
- "test" compiles and runs the test cases
- "Package" compiles, tests and packages to specified artifact, which is usually a jar file, hence slightly takes longer time compared to compile and test commands
- Now try changing the code to try different scenarios of programming

PS: Do not forget to commit the code bfore you leave the editor, to ensure all your changes are saved permenantly
